\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Welcome to our abstract algebra $\LaTeX$ notebook
    \item We are following the textbook found \textbf{\href{http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/index.html}{here}}
    \item To learn more about $\LaTeX$  see \textbf{\href{https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/amsmath/}{here}}
\end{itemize}

\section{Quickstart Guide}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I've set up this environment to use a modified version Prof Jeff Erickson's macros (you can see the original-ish version \textbf{\href{https://gist.github.com/xiaom/2922693}{here}} - I got them from a course website instead)
    \item To get started create a folder with your name on it using the left side bar.
    \item To create a new document for a chapter (or however you want to organize your workspace) I recommend creating a new document inside your folder and copy/pasting the contents of \texttt{template.tex}
\end{itemize}
